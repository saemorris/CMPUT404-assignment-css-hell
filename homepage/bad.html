            <h2>About Me</h2>
                Hi, I'm Sarah Morris.  I am in the last semester of my Computing Science Honours 
                degree at the University of Alberta.  I love to travel, and am constantly looking
                for new places to go and see.  To stay active I like to play badminton and soccer.

                <h2>What I Have to Offer</h2>
                I am someone who likes to work with challenging problems and find the best 
                solution, even if it does take a few tries to get there.
                <br>
                I have fair amount of experience with databases and like to work with them.  
                There is not much that makes me happier than getting a complex SQL to return 
                the right results.
